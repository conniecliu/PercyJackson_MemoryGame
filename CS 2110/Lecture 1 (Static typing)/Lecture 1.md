### Types 
##### Primitive Types 
- The most basic types in Java. They are predefined by the language and directly hold values. 
	- Integers (int)
	- doubles, floats
	- booleans 
- Some values can be converted to another type:
	- Implicit (widening): 
		- `1.8*20 + 32`
	- Explicit (casting):
		- `(double)3/5`
##### Reference Types
- Stores the reference of objects. They are used to point to objects created using classes, arrays, or interfaces. 
	- String 
	- ArrayList 
	- Default value (if not initialized) is null.

##### Static Types 
- Static typing (Java) allows expressions in source code have a type known at compile-time. 
	- thus, variables restrict what types of values can be stored in them. 
	- invalid operations are flagged before a program runs. 
- This is different from dynamic typing in python where values know what they type is at runtime and might discover an invalid operation in the middle of running a program.
